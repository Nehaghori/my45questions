/* Q no 19
Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries,
cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.*/
var foods = ["Biryani", " Green Chiken", " Turai", " Baingan", " Nihari"];
console.log("List of foods that i loveee :))))");
console.log(foods);
